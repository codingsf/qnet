- dirs for stunnel chroots must be created
- ryu and mininet must be installed
- qbcrypt/qbuncrypt(old version) must be placed in qnet/mininet/bin


prepare_vm.sh 
 - installs mininet, python-ryu, stunnel, openvswitch;
 - enables and starts openvswitch
 - creates stunnel chroots.


How to run:

1. Launch ryu controller
sample code is in ryu folder and can be launched using ./ryu.sh

2. run mininet 

to set alternate folders for keys one needs to set and export QCDIR and QCSUFFIX variables, defaults are:
export QCDIR=share/qbcrypt/
export QCSUFFIX=_Bob.key


python mininet-qnet.py

 - initializes all hosts with IP's in 10.0.0.0/24 network
 - starts sshd for each host  (one can ssh to each host for debugging)
 - starts stunnel, netcat and qcrypt according to configuration at 
https://github.com/itmo-infocom/qnet/blob/master/doc/network.png
 - starts mininet CLI (exit from CLI will remove mininet network from the VM and stops all launched processes on mininet host)

3. launch tests
./test.sh path_to_test_data

e.g. ./test.sh /root/qnet/mininet/share/test
