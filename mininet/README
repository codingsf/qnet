Scripts are intended to  run on Naulinux 7x VM 

Prerequisites:
- openvswitch must be installed, enabled and started
- dirs for stunnel chroots must be created
- ryu and mininet must be installed

prepare_vm.sh script enables and starts openvswitch, and creates stunnel chroots.



How to run:

1. Launch ryu controller
sample code is in ryu folder and can be launched using ./ryu.sh

2. run mininet 
python mininet-qnet.py

 - initializes all hosts with IP's in 10.0.0.0/24 network
 - starts sshd for each host  (one can ssh to each host for debugging)
 - starts stunnel, netcat and qcrypt according to configuration at 
https://github.com/itmo-infocom/qnet/blob/master/doc/network.png
 - starts mininet CLI (exit from CLI will remove mininet network from the VM and stops all launched processes on mininet host)

3. launch tests
./test.sh path_to_test_data

e.g. ./test.sh /root/qnet/mininet/share/test
